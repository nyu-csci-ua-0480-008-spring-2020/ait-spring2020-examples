every article has 1 author
an author can write multiple articles?
one to many

embedded documents
break apart blobs of strings... and have structured data
cons embedded docs:

* update anomaly: inconsistent data due to partial update
* redundant data, more space
* displaying unique values from embedded docs is more costly

0. having unstructured strings as fields
1. embedding
	* redundant data
	* inconsistent updates
	* costly to display unique embedded docs
	* good: get all data at once

2. separate documents
authn: you are who you say you are

how do you prove you are who you are

* username and password
* mfa - something you know and something you have
* have some 3rd party vouch for you

authz: are you allowed to do some thing


user
{
	username: jversoza
	password: f67e......
	salt: 8dfsdl2
}

reg:
1. generate salt
2. prepend append to incoming password
3. hash combo
4. store both hash AND salt in the database

login:
1. search for username
2. add salt to incoming pw
3. hash combo
4. check if same hash



added to password prior to hashing
hash - 1 way
encrypt - you can get back to plain text
so hash!!!!
1. leave it to someone else (use current best practices, bcrypt)
2. computationally expensive, collision resistant
